# daily-val

Dated, back-of-the-envelope **intrinsic-value reports** for stocks — one HTML
page per stock, per date, published as a static site via GitHub Pages.

Each report is **valuation only** — no market price. The page ships the
*inputs* and computes the value in your browser, so the numbers on the page are
always a live function of the assumptions it carries.

Two methods share one pipeline, selected by the input's `method` field: a
**DCF** (FCFF) for durable compounders, and a **relative comps** model
(peer/re-rating multiples — P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/B, EV/Sales on a forward metric)
for cyclicals and "new-paradigm" re-ratings where a smooth cash-flow stream is a
poor fit (e.g. MU). Both obey the same rules below.

## Every report is a frozen daily snapshot

The whole point of the name: **each report is a static, self-contained copy of
its own data on the day it was generated.** A published report never changes when
the shared reference JSON is later refreshed. Concretely, each run freezes:

- the **inputs** — base-year facts, per-scenario assumptions, and the **scenario
  probabilities**; and
- the **evaluation notes** — the plain-English "how defensible" read on every
  input, *including the read on the probabilities themselves*.

Both are written to a snapshot file, `docs/reports/<symbol>/<date>.json`
(`{ input, notes }`), and embedded into the report HTML. The reference files
under `skills/dcf/reference/` are just the mutable working drafts you edit before
generating tomorrow's report; the snapshot is the copy of record.

## Generate a report

```bash
# defaults to today's date
python3 scripts/generate_report.py AAPL

# or pin the date on the page
python3 scripts/generate_report.py AAPL --date 2026-07-15
```

The generator does **no** financial math. Each run freezes the symbol's input
JSON *and* its evaluation notes into `docs/reports/<symbol>/<date>.json`, embeds
the same data into `docs/reports/<symbol>/<date>.html`, records the run in
`docs/reports/manifest.json`, and rebuilds `docs/index.html`. The valuation
tables and the probability-weighted value are computed in the browser by the
method's engine — [`docs/assets/dcf.js`](docs/assets/dcf.js) or
[`docs/assets/comps.js`](docs/assets/comps.js), faithful ports of the matching
skill's Python engine. To post a report for a new date, run the command again
with a new `--date` and commit.

The symbol must have an input file under a reference root the generator knows:
`skills/dcf/reference/inputs/<SYMBOL>.json` (GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL) or
`skills/relative-comps/reference/inputs/<SYMBOL>.json` (MU), each with an optional
`notes/<SYMBOL>.json` evaluation sidecar. The input's `method` field (`"comps"`,
or absent for DCF) selects the engine. Refreshing the underlying financials for
the DCF skill uses its own `fetch_*.py` scripts and requires an API key
(`FINNHUB_API_KEY` in a gitignored `.env`).

## Publishing with GitHub Pages

The repo is **public** and GitHub Pages serves from `main` `/docs`, so the live
site is:

**https://yq-808.github.io/daily-val/**

Pushing to `main` redeploys it automatically.

## Disclaimer

Not investment advice. These are personal modeling exercises — a DCF is only as
good as its assumptions — not recommendations to buy or sell any security.
